The implementation code and the book differ quite a bit. I think the author didn't clean up his code and the tech reviewers did a bad job.

## 6.1 How long, in milliseconds, did you estimate for the ping requests and their response
message transmissions? How long do they actually take? Briefly comment on the
difference.

### My estimates:
Send time = resposne time = 1 ms
Process time = 100 us.

### Actual
3.237ms  1.992ms  1.921ms  1.973ms  1.939ms  1.939ms  1.922ms  1.923ms  1.917ms  1.898ms

### Discussion
The actual time is slightly less but very impressively close (2.1 - 2.066) / 2.066 = 1.6%. And I didn't even align the time.
The first one indeed took longer, about 1.2 ms longer. I was surprised that the pings are overlapping given that the code is blocking on receiving responses. Then I realized it is definitely because my Arch server has a later clock compared to my Fedora client, lovely. Because the numbers in the above output are T4 - T1, both of which are on the client, we can still trust those numbers. As for T3 being equal to T4 in the JSON file, I imagine there's some normailization in the KUTrace library (i.e. max() calls).

Based on the client4.cc code and the JSON structure, here's what each field in the "events" array represents:
Event Field Interpretation
Each event is an array with 15 fields representing an RPC transaction:

T1 (24.357147) - Request send timestamp (seconds) - when the client sends the RPC request
T2 (24.361981) - Server receive/process timestamp - when server received and started processing
T3 (24.362018) - Server send timestamp - when server finished and sent the response
T4 (24.362018) - Response receive timestamp - when client received the response
Client IP ("192.168.1.173") - IP address of the client machine
Server IP ("192.168.1.167") - IP address of the server machine
Request size (16.6) - Log scale of request size (lglen1) - indicates ~100KB request
Response size (16.6) - Log scale of response size (lglen2) - indicates ~100KB response
RPC ID (3355801765) - Unique 32-bit identifier for this RPC request
Parent ID (0) - Parent RPC ID for nested calls (0 means no parent)
Type ("RespRcv ") - RPC event type - "RespRcv" means Response Received at client
Method ("ping") - The RPC command/method being called
Status ("Success ") - Result status of the RPC
Data length (102413) - Actual data payload size in bytes (~100KB)
Data preview - Sample of the data payload (key/value with padding)

Key Timing Metrics

Network latency: T2 - T1 (time for request to reach server)
Server processing: T3 - T2 (deltaT23, which is 0 in your trace)
Response latency: T4 - T3 (time for response to reach client)
Total round-trip: T4 - T1 (complete RPC duration)

The last event [999.0, 0.0, ...] is a sentinel/terminator marking the end of the trace.
From your trace, these are "ping" RPCs with 100KB payloads (as indicated in the title), showing sub-5ms round-trip times between the client and server on what appears to be a local network (192.168.x.x addresses).

This is pretty stupid not to explain in the book. Pretty sure it's the case.
I think the start-up delay might be from network socket setup and connection.
"""
Looking at the HTML visualization code and your JSON data, the x-axis shows values around 356-382 ms because of how the visualization handles time display to keep axis labels manageable.
Here's what's happening:

Your data's actual timestamps: The JSON events have T1 (start time) values around 24.357147 to 24.376354 seconds from the trace base time.
Base time subtraction: The calculateBasetime() function in the JavaScript code automatically determines a "base time" to subtract from all displayed values. When the time span is small (your data spans only ~19 milliseconds), it sets the base time to the nearest whole second - in this case, 24 seconds.
Conversion to milliseconds: After subtracting the base time:

24.357147 - 24 = 0.357147 seconds
This gets multiplied by 1000 to show as 357.147 milliseconds
Similarly, 24.376354 becomes 376.354 milliseconds


Display optimization: The base time (24 seconds) is shown separately at the bottom left of the graph as "2025-09-18 03:11:24". This allows the axis to show just the millisecond-level detail (356-382) rather than the full timestamp, making the labels more readable.

This is a common visualization technique for time-series data - removing the common offset and showing just the relevant variation. The axis label "Time (msec)" indicates these are millisecond offsets from the base time shown at the bottom.
